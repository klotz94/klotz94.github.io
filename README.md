# Renewable Energy in Germany

Germany's transition to renewable energies from 1990 until 2015.

The visualization in this repository shows the expansion of renewable energy plants in Germany from 1990 until 2015. It was created with D3.js (slider is adapted from https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/6452972) and is based on the data of http://www.energymap.info.

The following types of energy plants are considered:

- Hydropower including wave, tidal, and flow energy
- Wind energy
- Solar energy (e.g. photovoltaic)
- Geothermal
- Energy from biomass including biogas and biomethane

# Run Visualization
The visualization can be easily run locally by using a simple http server e.g.
```
python -m htttp.server 8889
```
and then opening it in a browser http://localhost:8889/germany_map.html. Or you can directly view it on github.io at https://simon-sk.github.io/.
